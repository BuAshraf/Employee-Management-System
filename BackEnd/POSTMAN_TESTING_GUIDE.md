# Notification API Testing with Postman

## Prerequisites

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   - Make sure your Spring Boot application is running on `http://localhost:8080`
   - The server should be accessible and the database should be connected

2. **Authentication Setup**
   - You'll need a valid JWT token for authentication
   - First, login through your existing auth endpoint to get a token

## Step 1: Get Authentication Token

### Login Request
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "your_password"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "type": "Bearer",
    "username": "admin",
    "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

**Copy the token value for use in subsequent requests**

---

## Step 2: Setup Postman Environment

1. Create a new Environment in Postman called "EMS Notifications"
2. Add these variables:
   - `baseUrl`: `http://localhost:8080`
   - `token`: `[paste your JWT token here]`
   - `userId`: `1` (or your user ID)

message=Today is John Doe's birthday!
type=BIRTHDAY
priority=LOW
```

```
POST {{baseUrl}}/api/notifications/system
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

recipientId=1
title=Urgent Security Alert
message=Suspicious login activity detected on your account
type=ERROR
priority=URGENT
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Data in Database

After running tests, you can verify the data was created correctly:

### Check Notifications Table
```sql
SELECT * FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Notification Counts
```sql
SELECT 
    type, 
    priority, 
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_read = false THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as unread_count
FROM notifications 
GROUP BY type, priority;
```

---

## Testing Tips

1. **Test in Order**: Follow the test sequence to build up data
2. **Check Response Times**: APIs should respond within 200-500ms
3. **Verify Permissions**: Test with different user roles (Admin, HR, Employee)
4. **Test Pagination**: Use different page sizes and numbers
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty lists, invalid IDs, malformed requests

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No notifications found"
- **Solution**: Make sure you've created some notifications first

### Issue: "Unauthorized" errors
- **Solution**: Check your JWT token is valid and not expired

### Issue: "Method not allowed"
- **Solution**: Verify you're using the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Issue: Database connection errors
- **Solution**: Ensure your database is running and connection properties are correct

## Postman Collection Export

You can create a Postman collection with all these requests and export it for team use. Make sure to:

1. Use environment variables for baseUrl and token
2. Include example responses
3. Add test scripts to validate responses
4. Set up pre-request scripts for authentication if needed

This comprehensive testing suite will help you verify that your notification system is working correctly!
